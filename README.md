## Introduction
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

Hi, my name's Matt!

This repository is home to a landing page, created as a project for Udacity.
You can find out more about the project below, or check out my profile for some other cool projects I'm working on.

## About this project
[(Back to top)](#table-of-contents)

The project is built on a static template page provided by Udacity (this can be found in the resources section below).

The primary purpose of the project is create a dynamic landing page, using JavaScript to build an adaptive navigation menu. Additionally, each section of the page and navigation menu should display custom styling when in the *active* portion of the display. Selecting the navigation item should cause the page to scroll to the relevant section.

All elements and functionality should be fully supported across all devices.
